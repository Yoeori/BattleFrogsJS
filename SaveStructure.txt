# Saving

In the actual game there is no way to save, but the main purpose of this port is exercise in coding,

and what is better then finding a way to save the game? Making my own game? NOOOO....

### Structure

Every entity/screen will have a save and saveRestore function, this will return an array which when ready is put in a big array.

This array will have the following structure:<br />

Main -> 	entitys ->	1 ->	Position: [0,500]
					velocityY: -3000
				2 ->	guardPoint: [200, -2]
					behaviors ->	1 ->	returningSpeed: 2
							2 ->	patrolLength: 200
				3 ->	
		screen  ->	text: "Lol, text"
				image: new Image("Yayilist.png")
				spawntime: ∞
